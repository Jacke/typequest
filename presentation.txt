| \gSummary

Plan for this talk:
  - Beginner level shapeless and cats
  - Schema discovery problem
  - Two small, bite-sized chunks:
    - HList of parsers
    - Maps as semigroups
  - REPL-based (for extra adventure)
---
| \gThe Schema Discovery Problem

Consider a file like this:

  \b2014-01-01, 24.5,  True
  \b2014-01-02, 44.1,  True
  \b2014-01-03, 87.3, False
  \b2014-01-04,   42,  True
  \b       ...,  ...,   ...

What are the types in each column?
---
| \gSimple Heuristics

We'll use some heuristics:

  - if a String can be parsed as a type, then it
    may be an instance of that type

  - if there are only limited values in a column,
    then they might be categorical
---
| \gRestricted Problem

For simplicity, we'll only consider \bone \scolum
of the data
---
| \gImports

Imports we'll need later:

```
import shapeless._, poly._
import cats.syntax.all._
import cats.std.all._
```
---
| \gTrial Parsing

We want to test a list of parsers against each
value to see which parsers succeed.

```
case class Parser[T](
  parse: String => Option[T]
)
```
---
| \gExample Parsers

```
import scala.util.Try

val stringParser = Parser[String](
  Some.apply
)

val doubleParser = Parser[Double](
  s => Try(s.toDouble).toOption
)
```
---
| \gTrying the Parsers

```
val cell = "Hello"

val sres = stringParser.parse(cell)
val dres = doubleParser.parse(cell)
```
---
| \gList of Parsers

```
val plist = stringParser :: doubleParser :: Nil
val res = plist.map(_.parse(cell))
```

This approach works, but we lose the type information:
  res :: List[Option[Any]]
---
| \gInstead: HList of Parsers

```
val phlist = stringParser :: doubleParser :: HNil
val res = phlist.map(_.parse(cell))
```

Doesn't work: Scala can't figure out the type of
the function because it's polymorphic:
  - Parser[String]
  - Parser[Double]

---
| \gParsing as a Polymorphic Function

To fix this, we need a Shapeless polymorphic function:

```
object pparse extends Poly1 {
  implicit def parse[T] = at[Parser[T]](_.parse(cell))
}

val phlist = stringParser :: doubleParser :: HNil
val res = phlist map pparse
```

Still doesn't work!
---
| \gType Constraint Trick (Travis Brown)

```
object pparse extends Poly1 {
  implicit def parse[T, S]
    (implicit ev: S <:< Parser[T]) =
      at[S](_.parse(cell))
}

val phlist = stringParser :: doubleParser :: HNil

val res = phlist map pparse
```

Success!
---
| \gRemaining Parts

Suggestions for completing this functionality:

  - Include the cell value as a parameter (eg. zip
    it with the list of parsers)

  - Package as a function
---
| \gMaps as Semigroups

Consider a column containing the following values:

```
val col = List("True", "True", "False", "True", "False")
```

To identify categorical variables, we need to
aggregate a count of the values in this list to
produce:

```
val expected = Map("True" -> 3, "False" -> 2)
```

What is the fastest way to achieve this?
---
| \gTransform to Single-Element Maps

First step can be to transform the list to a list of
single-element maps:

```
col map (item => Map(item -> 1))
```
---
| \gCombining Maps

We need to sum values in the maps which share the
same keys:

```
val res = col
    .map(item => Map(item -> 1))
    .combineAll
```
---
| \gHow Did That Work?

Values in the map are semigroup instances

Cats (via non/algebra) allows you to construct a
monoid and semigroup for a Map provided that its
values are semigroup instances
---
| \gSemigroup

A semigroup is:
  - a set, with
  - an associative binary operator; ie:
      (x |+| y) |+| z = x |+| (y |+| z)

eg: (Int, +) form a semigroup:
  - (x + y) + z = x + (y + z)
---
| \gMonoid

A monoid is:
  - a semigroup, with
  - an identity element (i), such that for every
    element of the monoid (e):
      i |+| e = e |+| i = e

eg: (Int, +, 0) form a monoid:
  - (Int, +) forms a semigroup
  - 0 + e = e + 0 = e
---
| \gIn Our Example

In our case, Int and Map[_, Int] are acting as
semigroups

Addition is the binary operator for Int

Addition of values with the same key is the
binary operator for maps

| \gWrapping Up

In summary:
  - type discovery
  - good introductory problem
  - HLists from shapeless
  - Monoid and Semigroup from cats
